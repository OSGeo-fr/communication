Galette's interface is enhanced with Javascript.

Our choice has been JQuery (fast, easy, and so on) - http://jquery.com

We use several plugins in addition to the JQuery core. Here is the list of the
plugins that are used into Galette:
- UI (http://jqueryui.com/) for various things, including:
    - UI datepicker, for calendar date selection
    - UI Sorter, to sort lists easyly
    - UI Tooltips
    - UI Dialogs
    - ...
- farbtatsic (http://acko.net/dev/farbtastic), a color picker
- bgFade (no url :/) for gradient background effects
