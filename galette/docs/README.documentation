Galette documentation can be generated using phpDocumentor.

A file named phpDocumentor.ini is provided to automate the process. 
To generate the documentation, edit this file to replace 'target' line
with the path where you would to build it.

Example:
target = /home/user/galette/doc

Once you've edited phpDocumentor.ini, save it to disk then run the build 
process (from galette/docs/ direcotry):
phpdoc --useconfig phpDocumentor.ini

HTML files will be generated into 'target' directory.
